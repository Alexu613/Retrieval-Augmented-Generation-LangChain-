# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-LangChain-
Large Language Models (LLMs) power computers, phones, and apps, but their knowledge is limited to training data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) connects LLMs with external data. In this notebook, youâ€™ll learn to load, process, and query data using LangChain, vector databases, and Graph RAG.
